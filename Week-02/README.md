# Week 2: Universo

## The prompt
`Universo` was announced without any fanfare, more or less at the same time we told each other that we had posted the first challenge, [Araucária](../Week-01/). 

# The creative process
I knew from the beginning that I would not be exploring ideas related to galaxies and the stars. Instead, I wanted to surprise Régis with another impression of infinity. I got some inspiration after looking into [antique maps of the world and stars](https://www.google.se/search?q=antique+maps+of+the+universe&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj34-yZj5_bAhWLECwKHVg8AyIQ_AUICigB&biw=1536&bih=734), and wanted to try something with the [golden rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle) and its subdivisions.
