There are 20 extant species in New Caledonia (where 14 species are endemic, see New Caledonian Araucaria), Norfolk Island, eastern Australia, New Guinea, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil."

msgid "`Araucária` was the very first prompt for the :doc:`index` project. The other options offered to `Régis Frias <https://github.com/regisfrias/dear-gen>`_ were spider web, and `oca indígena`. All three images came to my head during a train ride between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, while the idea for the project materialized."

msgid "When talking about generating tree with code, one is likely to come across `Lindenmayer systems, or L-systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system>`_. Danniel Shifman has an `excellent tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1B4UoSQMFw>`_ on the subject, which is a great way to familiarize yourself with L-systems and their possibilities. I was not able to find any L-system remotely close to the araucária image I wanted, and quickly gave up trying to come up with a set of productions to achieve that. The next idea I explored was to use polynomial curves to draw branches, and use a mere circle to represent the leaves."
