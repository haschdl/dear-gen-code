msgid "*Palha* is Portuguese for hay, and in the Brazil's southeast region it is an epitome of the \"caipira\", a person from the countryside, usually a rural worker, who wears an unsophisticated form of hay hat to protect from the sun. As rural populations decreased, the usage of term was expanded to refer also to an urban citizen of smaller cities."
