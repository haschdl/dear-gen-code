CONTRIBUTING
============

Sketches are written in Javascript, using the p5.js library.

There are no requirements to add new sketches, however we do recommend using eslint for formatting and consistency of the Javascript code.

1. Make sure you have `yarn` installed
2. Install pre-requisites
   
    `yarn add`
