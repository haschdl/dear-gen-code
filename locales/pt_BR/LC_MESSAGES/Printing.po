"The first option was using an on-line service for printing a single copy "
"of a card. Of the services available in Sweden, I found one which make "
"single copies of cards. The aspect ratio was 2:1, which was a good fit "
"for the first week's design, `Araucária <Week-01-Araucaria>`_. I also "
"experimented with printing the source code in the inner pages of the "
"folded card - it turned out to be a great way to talk about the project "
"and share ideas, but it wouldn't work a real post card, as the source "
"code filled up the space for a hand-written message. While I really liked"
" the quality of the print, it would be too expensive to use this option "
"for all cards, therefore I did only one copy with the online service."

"For the second week, I experimented with printing the card myself. I "
"haven't had a printer for a long time, but given my motivation with the "
"project and since I wanted to experiment and have control on the paper I "
"used, I decided to try with the cheapest printer I could find (HP Deskjet"
" 3700 Series). Cheaper printers do not print borderless, therefore I used"
" an A5 paper and cut the excess with an knife after printing. It's a bit "
"manual, but it gives an artisan touch to the final post card. It took "
"some trial and error to be able to print correctly, after which I settle "
"with the workflow using Inkspace to print both the front and back of the "
"card. I was sold on this approach when I learned that Inkspace has a "
"built-in `feature to generate QR codes <http://goinkscape.com/how-to-"
"make-qr-codes-in-inkscape/>`_, which was the final geek touch to the "
"card."

"You can download the Inkscape files for the post template from the links "
