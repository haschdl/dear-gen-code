"*At the rose garden* was an experiment with the ideas presented by artist"
" Tyler Hobbs in his article *A generative approach to simulating "
"watercolor paints* [1]_. The idea of the algorithm is to draw a polygon, "
"for example a decahedron, and replace each side AB with two new segments,"
" AC' and C'B, where C' is a point around the midpoint C between A an B. "
"Taylor uses the Gaussian distribution to determine C' from C, meaning "
"most points will be very close to C, and a few will be very distant from "
"C, causing an organic feel to the distortion."
