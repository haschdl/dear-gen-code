"I knew from the beginning that I would not be exploring ideas related to "
"galaxies and the stars. Instead, I wanted to surprise Régis with another "

"`antique maps of the world and stars`_, and wanted to try something with "
"the `golden rectangle`_ and its subdivisions."

"The first challenge was to draw the subdivisions. There are some more "
"sophisticated approaches using ``scale()`` command, but I couldn’t get my"
" head around those, so I tried to reproduce the sequence from the largest"
" to the smaller squares in a loop, following the movement of the "
"subdivisions, in relation the previous one - basically drawing one "
"square, translating, drawing a smaller square etc. In every step, the "
"size of the rectangle ``s`` is divided by φ, getting smaller and smaller."
" The algorithm is as follows:"
