# Dear Gen Project Code

This is the repository for the code of the [Dear Gen Project](https://github.com/regisfrias/dear-gen-book).

The project was inspired by [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/) and conceived by [Half Scheidl](https://github.com/haschdl). It is as a series of (almost) weekly challenges meant to be sent by mail (the postal service, that is).

We are writing about each challenge as we go and the compiled text can be found at https://book.dear-gen.art/.
