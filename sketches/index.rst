Dear Gen
________

A generative postal art project

This project was inspired by `Dear Data <http://www.dear-data.com/>`_ and conceived by `Half Scheidl <https://github.com/haschdl>`_. 
It is as a series of weekly challenges meant to be sent by mail (the postal service, that is).

Every monday we take turns in selecting a design prompt, a one-word idea which evolves into a digital drawing, and it is then posted 
by mail within exactly one week. We will be publishing the source code for the previous week as soon as both of us have received the 
card at our homes. All drawings are made with Processing [1]_.
