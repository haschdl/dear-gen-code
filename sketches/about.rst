Dear Gen is a collaborative project in generative art, initiated by `Half Scheidl <https://github.com/haschdl>`_ 
and `RÃ©gis Frias <http://regisfrias.com/>`_. It is a series of weekly drawing challenges, meant to be sent 
by mail (the postal service, that is).

Every monday we take turns in selecting a design prompt, a one-word idea which evolves into a digital drawing, 
and it is then posted by mail within exactly one week. We will be publishing the source code for the previous 
week as soon as both of us have received the card at our homes. All drawings are made with Processing [1]_.

The project draws inspiration from the beautiful `Dear Data <http://www.dear-data.com/>`_ project, by information 
designers Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec.
