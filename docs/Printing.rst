Printing
========

All images generated in the project were meant to be printed and sent via mail, as 
a post-card. I experimented with a few options before sticking to the home-made printed version. 

Ordering it online
--------------------------
The first option was using an on-line service for printing a single copy of a card. Of the services available in Sweden, 
I found one which make single copies of cards. The aspect ratio was 2:1, which was a good fit for the first week's design, `Araucária <Week-01-Araucaria>`_. 
I also experimented with printing the source code in the inner pages of the folded card - it turned out 
to be a great way to talk about the project and share ideas, but it wouldn't work a real post card, as the source code filled up the 
space for a hand-written message. While I really liked the quality of the print, it would be too expensive to use this option
for all cards, therefore I did only one copy with the online service.

Printing yourself
-----------------
For the second week, I experimented with printing the card myself. I haven't had a printer for a long time, but given my motivation 
with the project and since I wanted to experiment and have control on the paper I used, I decided to try with the cheapest printer 
I could find (HP Deskjet 3700 Series). Cheaper printers do not print borderless, therefore I used an A5 paper and cut the excess 
with an knife after printing. It's a bit manual, but it gives an artisan touch to the final post card.
It took some trial and error to be able to print correctly, after which I settle with the workflow using Inkspace to print both the front 
and back of the card. I was sold on this approach when I learned that Inkspace 
has a built-in `feature to generate QR codes <http://goinkscape.com/how-to-make-qr-codes-in-inkscape/>`_, which was the final geek touch to the card.

Downloads
---------
You can download the Inkscape files for the post template from the links below.
Inkscape uses the SVG format for the files, so in theory it can be opened in other 
tools, but I haven't tested it.
