    Araucária (Araucaria)


From `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucaria>`_::

        Araucaria (/ærɔːˈkɛəriə/; original pronunciation: [a.ɾawˈka. ɾja]) is a genus of 
        evergreen coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae. There are 20 extant species 
        in New Caledonia (where 14 species are endemic, see New Caledonian Araucaria), Norfolk Island, 
        eastern Australia, New Guinea, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.

The prompt
----------
`Araucária` was the very first prompt for the :doc:`index` project. The other options offered to `Régis Frias <https://github.com/regisfrias/dear-gen>`_ were spider web, and `oca indígena`. All three images came to my head during a train ride between Amsterdam and Rotterdam, while the idea for the project materialized.

The creative process
--------------------
When talking about generating tree with code, one is likely to come across `Lindenmayer systems, or L-systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system>`_. Danniel Shifman has an `excellent tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1B4UoSQMFw>`_ on the subject, which is a great way to familiarize yourself with L-systems and their possibilities.
I was not able to find any L-system remotely close to the araucária image I wanted, and quickly gave up trying to come up with a set of productions to achieve that. 
The next idea I explored was to use polynomial curves to draw branches, and use a mere circle to represent the leaves.

    The basic shape of a single tree in the composition

Once the basic shape seemed ok, the next step was to create several copies of it, and distribute them on the canvas in a matrix, with minor displacements to give a more
organic look.
